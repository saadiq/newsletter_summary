# App Structure Overview

The main entry point is @main.py, which orchestrates the workflow for summarizing AI newsletters. The codebase is modularized as follows:

- @auth.py: Handles Gmail OAuth authentication and token management.
- @fetch.py: Fetches and parses emails from Gmail, applying filters and extracting relevant fields.
- @nlp.py: Cleans email bodies and extracts key topics using classic n-gram or KeyBERT+clustering methods. Returns topics sorted by relevance score (higher is better). Includes filtering to exclude newsletter metadata and irrelevant topics. Also includes direct-LLM topic extraction via a delegate function.
- @llm.py: Performs contextual summarization, NER/event detection, and prompts an LLM (OpenAI or Anthropic) for actionable summaries. Uses the direct-LLM approach by default via analyze_newsletters_unified() that produces topics and summaries in a single step. Also supports the traditional two-step approach. Now includes OpenRouter integration for cost tracking and analytics.
- @report.py: Generates the final markdown report, including top developments, sources, and methodology. Handles newsletter website mapping and caching.
- @review_newsletter_websites.py: CLI tool for reviewing and verifying newsletter website mappings in the cache.
- @analyze_costs.py: Analyzes and reports on OpenRouter usage costs and token consumption patterns.
- @verify_openrouter.py: Tests the OpenRouter integration to ensure it's properly configured.

## Key Features

- Uses direct-to-LLM approach by default for streamlined processing (traditional NLP-based approach optional with --traditional-nlp flag)
- Supports up to 10 topics (default) ordered by importance
- Enhanced topic filtering to exclude newsletter metadata, account information, and layout-related content
- Improved context examples with HTML cleanup for better topic relevance
- Configurable via command-line arguments including number of topics and analysis method
- OpenRouter integration for cost tracking and analytics of LLM API calls
- Fallback mechanisms to handle API failures gracefully

## Testing

- @test_fetch_api.py: Unit tests for email fetching and parsing logic.
- @test_e2e_cli.py: End-to-end tests for the CLI workflow and report generation.

## Configuration

- Environment variables: Control API keys, output directory, and OpenRouter settings
- Command-line arguments: Control behavior for each run (days, label, provider, etc.)
- `.env.local`: Local environment configuration (API keys, OpenRouter settings)

Supporting files include @requirements.txt, @requirements-dev.txt, @newsletter_websites.json (website cache), and configuration files for environment variables and tokens.
