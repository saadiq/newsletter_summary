## **OpenAI Expands Deep Research for Free Users, Launches GPT-Image-1 API for Developers**

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/e846494d-9975-402b-975e-1ea7e0a1fe0a/lightweight.jpg?t=1745585064)
Caption: Image: OpenAI

OpenAI has introduced a cost-efficient, lightweight version of its Deep Research feature for free-tier ChatGPT users, offering up to five queries per month. This version runs on the o4-mini model, providing comparable depth to the standard o3-powered tool, though responses may be shorter. Paid users on Plus, Pro, and Team plans can access additional queries, with automatic fallback to o4-mini once the o3 limit is exceeded.

In related updates, OpenAI's models continue to perform [strongly](https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1915078057452573142) on the LMSYS Arena leaderboard, with the o3 model securing the #2 spot and excelling in math, coding, and style control. The o4-mini also ranks highly, particularly in mathematical tasks.

[OpenAI’s Open Model to Invoke Cloud for Complex Queries](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/openai-wants-its-open-ai-model-to-call-models-in-the-cloud-for-help/): OpenAI is set to release its first fully downloadable AI model in years, designed to outperform open-source models from Meta and DeepSeek. Internally dubbed a “reasoning” model, it may feature an optional “handoff” capability, enabling it to invoke OpenAI’s larger, cloud-hosted models for complex queries via API. 

The handoff concept, proposed by a developer during a community event, has reportedly gained traction within OpenAI. While the exact tools and pricing structure remain unclear, the company is training the model from scratch rather than adapting an existing one.

[Revenue Projections: OpenAI Eyes $174B by 2030](https://the-decoder.com/openai-reportedly-plans-to-grow-revenue-from-4-billion-to-174-billion-by-2030/): OpenAI expects its revenue to grow from $4 billion in 2024 to $174 billion by 2030, driven by AI agents, new products, and monetization strategies. Agents like “Operator” could generate $29 billion by 2029, with $50B from subscriptions and $22B from APIs.

[GPT-Image-1 API Launches for Developers](https://the-decoder.com/openai-adds-chatgpt-image-model-gpt-image-1-to-api-for-developers/): OpenAI has released its [GPT-Image-1](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-image-1) model —originally integrated into ChatGPT—via API, expanding access to high-fidelity image generation and analysis tools for developers. The model supports text-to-image synthesis with precise prompt alignment and image interpretation across PNG, JPEG, WEBP, and GIF formats. Input can be submitted via URL or Base64, with output resolution capped at 768×2000 pixels.

Youtube: OpenAI's New GPT Image Model API in 5 Minutes 📸 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-G71JZA75A)

Pricing is usage-based: $5 per million tokens for text prompts, $10 for image inputs, and $40 for image outputs, with per-image costs ranging from $0.02 to $0.19 depending on detail. Safety measures match ChatGPT-4o, including C2PA metadata and content moderation, and API data is excluded from training.

## **Anthropic Targets AI Black Box Transparency and Welfare Research by 2027**

Anthropic has launched a research program focused on AI "[model welfare](https://www.anthropic.com/research/exploring-model-welfare)," investigating whether AI systems could experience human-like traits such as distress or consciousness. This initiative follows a report co-authored by philosopher David Chalmers, suggesting [AI might develop consciousness and agency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00986). The research will explore the ethical implications of these possibilities, looking for signs of distress or preferences in AI models.

Youtube: Could AI models be conscious? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXouxa0WnY)

Led by Kyle Fish, the research will analyze both behavioral responses—such as how models react to choices—and internal mechanisms that could align with theories of consciousness. While no consensus exists on whether AI can achieve consciousness, Anthropic is proceeding cautiously, acknowledging the uncertainty in the field.

Additionally, CEO Dario Amodei has outlined plans to improve [AI model interpretability by 2027](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/anthropic-ceo-wants-to-open-the-black-box-of-ai-models-by-2027/), urging the AI industry to ramp up efforts in mechanistic interpretability to mitigate risks of autonomous decision-making.

## **Google’s Gemini Surpasses 350 Million Users, Gaining Ground on ChatGPT**

Google has teamed up with HHMI Janelia and Harvard to release [ZAPBench](https://research.google/blog/improving-brain-models-with-zapbench/), a comprehensive brain activity dataset aimed at refining predictive models of brain function. Capturing data from approximately 70,000 neurons in a larval zebrafish's brain, the dataset offers new insights into how neural activity correlates with brain structure. With ZAPBench, researchers can compare and enhance models that track brain activity over time. The next step will be incorporating a full connectome to increase model accuracy.

Tweet:  (https://twitter.com/GoogleAI/status/1915454869248282651)

Meanwhile, Google's Gemini chatbot has reached [350 million active users](https://the-decoder.com/googles-gemini-chatbot-claims-350-million-users-but-the-true-number-may-be-much-higher/), with the actual number likely higher due to its integration with platforms like Google Search and Android. While it still lags behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which has over 500 million weekly users, the latest Gemini 2.5 Pro strengthens Google's position in the AI race. Notably, in today’s earnings call, Google revealed that [over a third of all code generated ](https://x.com/AndrewCurran_/status/1915533246072537555)at the company is now produced by AI.

Youtube: Using AI to create music 🎵 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XapqiCm9S8)

On the creative side, Google’s Music AI Sandbox has enhanced its features and expanded access for artists. The platform [now includes Lyria 2](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/music-ai-sandbox-now-with-new-features-and-broader-access/), an advanced music generation model offering high-fidelity audio. Tools like "Create," "Extend," and "Edit" help artists explore genres and compose new tracks, while Lyria RealTime enables real-time music creation.

<hr/><p><strong><mark>TREND</mark></strong></p><h3>The Rise of Frontier Firms: AI Agents and the Future of Work</h3>
<div>
<a><img/></a>
</div><p>Microsoft’s latest research introduces the concept of “Frontier Firms,” where hybrid teams of humans and AI agents collaborate, reshaping productivity, management, and the future of work. It reports significant productivity improvements, including a 35% increase in task completion speed and a 28% boost in decision-making accuracy, thanks to AI's data processing capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>AI has transitioned from a mere tool to an active collaborator, now capable of understanding context and providing nuanced recommendations, fundamentally changing decision-making dynamics.</li>
<li>These organizations are characterized by AI-human collaboration, on-demand intelligence generation, agile design in team structures, continuous learning, and a data-driven culture.</li>
<li>Managers now oversee hybrid teams, necessitating technical literacy in AI, ethical oversight for AI operations, and adept change management to facilitate human-AI collaboration.</li>
</ul><p>The emergence of Frontier Firms signals a pivotal shift in the employment landscape. As organizations increasingly adopt hybrid AI-human teams, we can expect a significant transformation in productivity and management practices. This evolution not only enhances operational efficiency but also redefines roles, positioning human workers to focus on creativity and complex problem-solving.</p><p></p>

<hr/><p><strong><mark>CROSSROADS</mark></strong></p><h3>A Founder Wants AI To Completely Replace Humans</h3>
<div>
<a><img/></a>
</div><p>The launch of Mechanize by AI researcher Tamay Besiroglu has ignited a fierce debate about the future of work, automation, and the ethical implications of replacing human labor with artificial intelligence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Besiroglu aims for "full automation of the economy" through AI systems capable of performing all human jobs, starting with customer support and financial services, highlighting a market potential of $60 trillion.</li>
<li>The announcement has provoked extensive criticism, particularly regarding job displacement, economic inequality, and the erosion of human purpose. Critics question Besiroglu's shift from ethical AI governance to a profit-driven venture.</li>
<li>Supporters argue that full automation could lead to economic growth, higher living standards, and allow humans to pursue more creative and innovative endeavors, suggesting a cultural shift in the perception of work.</li>
</ul><p>The emergence of Mechanize is a watershed moment in the conversation around AI and labor. As we stand at this crossroads, we must confront the dual-edged sword that automation presents. While the economic advantages of a fully automated society are tantalizing, the potential fallout—job loss, increased inequality, and a crisis of purpose—cannot be overlooked.</p><p></p>

**Good morning, AI enthusiasts.** Anthropic just took the AI consciousness debate from science fiction to serious research — launching a new program to develop frameworks for assessing potential model welfare.

With their own researcher estimating a 15% chance that models are already conscious, are we nearing the existential debate on whether digital minds deserve ethical treatment?

———————————————————————————

**In today’s AI rundown:**

* Anthropic’s new research explores AI welfare

* Adobe’s new Firefly models, AI integrations

* Turn your terminal into an AI coding assistant

* Google DeepMind expands Music AI Sandbox

* 4 new AI tools &amp; 4 job opportunities

**The Rundown: **Anthropic just [launched](https://www.anthropic.com/research/exploring-model-welfare) a new research program dedicated to “model welfare,” exploring the complex ethical questions around whether future AI systems might gain consciousness or deserve moral consideration in the future.

**The details: **

* Research areas include developing frameworks to assess consciousness, studying indicators of AI preferences and distress, and exploring interventions.

* Anthropic hired its first AI welfare researcher, Kyle Fish, in 2024 to explore consciousness in AI — who estimates a 15% chance models are conscious.

* The initiative follows increasing AI capabilities and a [recent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00986) report (co-authored by Fish) suggesting AI consciousness is a near-term possibility.

* Anthropic emphasized deep uncertainty around these questions, noting no scientific consensus on whether current or future systems could be conscious.

**Why it matters: **Sam Altman previously [likened](https://x.com/tsarnick/status/1797104717040062558) AI to a form of alien intelligence. Soon, these models may reach a level that changes how we understand consciousness and ethics about them. We’ll likely see a polarizing divide—especially since there’s no  threshold for when an AI could be considered “conscious” or deserving of rights.

###### ADOBE

**The Rundown: **Adobe just [launched](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/04/24/adobe-firefly-next-evolution-creative-ai-is-here) a major expansion of its Firefly AI platform at its MAX London event, introducing two new powerful image generation models, third-party integrations, a new collaborative workspace, and an upcoming mobile app.

**The details:**

* The new Firefly Image Model 4 and 4 Ultra boost generation quality, realism, control, and speed, while supporting up to 2K resolution outputs.

* Firefly's web app now offers access to third-party models like OpenAI's GPT ImageGen, Google's Imagen 3 and Veo 2, and Black Forest Labs’ Flux 1.1 Pro.

* Firefly’s text-to-video capabilities are now out of beta, alongside the official release of its text-to-vector model.

* Adobe also launched Firefly Boards in beta for collaborative AI moodboarding and announced the upcoming release of a new Firefly mobile app.

* Adobe’s models are all commercially safe and IP-friendly, with a new [Content Authenticity](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/04/24/adobe-content-authenticity-now-public-beta-helps-creators-secure-attribution) allowing users to easily apply AI-identifying metadata to work.

**Why it matters: **OpenAI’s recent image generator and other rivals have shaken up creative workflows, but Adobe’s IP-safe focus and the addition of competing models into Firefly allow professionals to remain in their established suite of tools — keeping users in the ecosystem while still having flexibility for other model strengths.

###### GOOGLE DEEPMIND

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/d9674a00-c421-482f-a545-dd8b4343439d/googlemusic.jpg?t=1745528612)
Caption: Image source: Google DeepMind

**The Rundown: **Google DeepMind just [released](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/music-ai-sandbox-now-with-new-features-and-broader-access/) new upgrades to its Music AI Sandbox, introducing its new Lyria 2 music generation model alongside new creation and editing features for professional musicians. 

**The details: **

* The platform’s new “Create,” “Extend,” and “Edit” features allow musicians to generate tracks, continue musical ideas, and transform clips via text prompts.

* The tools are powered by the upgraded Lyria 2 model, which features higher-fidelity, professional-grade audio generation compared to previous versions.

* DeepMind also unveiled Lyria RealTime, a version of the model enabling interactive, real-time music creation and control by blending styles on the fly.

* Access to the experimental Music AI Sandbox is expanding to more musicians, songwriters, and producers in the U.S. for broader feedback and exploration.

**Why it matters: **Google is targeting professional musicians, positioning Lyria 2 and the Sandbox as co-creation partners rather than just novelty music generators. The creative landscape for musicians is being reshaped by AI, like every other medium, but these tools are a big step in normalizing its currently polarizing use in the industry.

## **AI Tutorial **


----------

----------
Financial management is a deeply personal and context-sensitive domain where one-size-fits-all AI solutions fall short. Building truly helpful AI financial advisors requires understanding the interplay between budgeting, saving, and debt management as interconnected rather than isolated concerns.

A multi-agent system provides the perfect architecture for this approach, allowing us to craft specialized agents that collaborate rather than operate in silos, mirroring how human financial advisors actually work.

In this tutorial, we'll build a Multi-Agent Personal Financial Coach application using _**[Google’s newly released Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)**_ and the Gemini model. Our application will feature specialized agents for budget analysis, savings strategies, and debt reduction, working together to provide comprehensive financial advice. The system will offer actionable recommendations with interactive visualizations.

We share hands-on tutorials like this every week, designed to help you stay ahead in the world of AI. _**[If you're serious about leveling up your AI skills and staying ahead of the curve, subscribe now and be the first to access our latest tutorials.](https://www.theunwindai.com/subscribe)**_

Welcome, humans. 

Required reading time! So, y'know how there's a backlash against “just putting AI everywhere” in products we use daily? YC Partner Pete Koomen [just nailed ](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless-carriages/)[_why_](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless-carriages/).

He says most current AI features are “[horseless carriages](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless-carriages/#horseless-carriages)”—they jam AI into old UIs instead of rebuilding for an AI-first world. Using Gmail's clunky AI draft feature as exhibit A, Koomen shows how it takes MORE time than just writing the email yourself.

His key insight: YOU should control the System Prompt for any AI acting on your behalf. Most AI apps should be "agent builders," not pre-configured agents. Example:

We'll take it further: _everyone's too lazy to rebuild their codebase for AI—but that's exactly what's needed._ For AI to be actually useful, it needs to be able to actually do things for us. That’s why you’re seeing such an emphasis on [“Computer use” agents](https://github.com/steel-dev/awesome-web-agents) right now. 

_We’ll literally teach AI how to use computers like humans do before we’ll give humans the tools to create actually useful AI apps. _

The piece is packed with interactive demos showing how much better user-controlled AI could be. Definitely worth the full read (and [great discussion on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43773813)).

**Here’s what you need to know about AI today:**

* Microsoft released a new Work Trend Index report.

* OpenAI projected $174B in revenue by 2030. 

* Google's antitrust case revealed some wild facts. 

* The US government ordered AI in K-12 schools.

# Microsoft says we're in “The Year of the Frontier Firm”... but what does that ACTUALLY mean?

Is your company hiring AI agents as employees? According to Microsoft's new [Work Trend Index report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/2025-the-year-the-frontier-firm-is-born), that's exactly what leading companies are doing in 2025.

Microsoft analyzed data from 31K workers across 31 countries and found the emergence of a new kind of organization they're calling the “Frontier Firm”—companies powered by intelligence on tap and hybrid teams of humans and AI agents.

In a one-on-one chat with Microsoft’s Chief Marketing Officer, AI at Work[ Jared Spataro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredspa), he told us that after studying AI-native firms for a year and a half, they've observed a significant shift from employees caring about AI to employers driving AI adoption.

**The research highlights three major shifts happening right now:**

1. **Intelligence is becoming a utility you can purchase.** With 82% of leaders planning to use AI agents in the next 12-18 months, “digital labor” is becoming as essential as electricity. 

  1. **The need is clear:** 53% of leaders say productivity must increase, but 80% of workers lack the time or energy to deliver more.

2. **Human-agent teams are replacing traditional org charts.** Nearly half of leaders say they're already using agents to fully automate workflows. 

  1. This is creating what Microsoft calls a “Work Chart”—where teams form around goals rather than functions.

3. **Everyone's becoming an “agent boss.”** The most valuable skill now is managing AI agents, not just using them. 

  1. Leaders are ahead of employees here–67% of leaders are familiar with agents versus just 40% of employees.

**The report shares some impressive real-world results, too: **

* Wells Fargo built an agent for 35K bankers, cutting query time from 10 minutes to 30 seconds.

* Dow created agents to find hidden shipping losses, expecting to save millions.

* Bayer's researchers each save 6 hours weekly using agents.

**The secret to success?** Spataro revealed that high-quality input is crucial: “One little-known secret is grounding agents on really high-quality input content.” He advises creating really good briefs for projects and using the agents to scale out. 

**This caused us to ask: **What makes a good brief? It turns out, the same things that make a good prompt! 

**Get this: **Spataro also shared his #1 piece of advice for anyone looking to add “Agent Boss” to their resume. _Spoiler alert: start getting your hands dirty. _

# Prompt Tip of the Day

Everyone’s concerned about AI taking jobs, so [here’s a prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1k2vluo/this_one_prompt_turned_my_resume_into_a_job/) to use AI to help you GET a job. There’s also [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1k2vluo/comment/mnxa172/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button), an alternate version shared in the comments. 

The poster CLAIMS they used this (and had TikTok followers reply that it helped them get a job), but no guarantees. Either way, it’s probably a good starting point to help you update your resume if you don’t have any other resources!

# Around the Horn.

* [Sam Altman said on X](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless-carriages/) that OpenAI doubled the rate limits for o3 and o4-mini-high for Plus subscribers, and that the [OpenAI](https://x.com/sama/status/1915110344894435587)_[ imagen](https://x.com/sama/status/1915110344894435587)_ (_pass it on!_) is now available via API with special controls for moderation sensitivity, quality, speed, background, output format, and more for $5/1M text or $10/1M image input and $40/1M image output, so [~2-19 cents per image](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/openai-makes-its-upgraded-image-generator-available-to-developers/) ([docs here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation?image-generation-model=gpt-image-1)). 

* [OpenAI](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-forecasts-revenue-topping-125-billion-2029-agents-new-products-gain?rc=lks9on) forecasted $125B in revenue by 2029 and $174B by 2030, but get this: it expects the majority of this revenue to come from agents and new products, not ChatGPT alone. 

* [The US government](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/23/trump-order-artificial-intelligence-schools-ai/83230792007/) will now integrate AI into K-12 education, establish AI courses for students, and create a White House Task Force on AI Education.

* There’s a ton of juicy data coming out of Google’s antitrust court case right now: 

  * Like how Google’s contract w/ Motorola [apparently blocked the company](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/perplexity-executive-says-google-blocked-motorola-s-use-of-ai-assistant?embedded-checkout=true) from making Perplexity the default AI assistant on its devices…

* Or how [Gemini’s chatbot](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/googles-gemini-user-numbers-revealed-court) has about 35M daily active users and 350 monthly active users last month (vs 160M daily and 600M monthly for GPT)… 

* …And how ChatGPT has scooped up some “[homework and math](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/chatgpt-cannibalizing-google-search-commercial-queries)” search queries from Google, but not the profitable ones (like searches where someone wants to buy something)… _yet. _

* We don’t cover chip stuff here, but SemiAnalysis does (and is arguably the best in the business at it), and it just [released a new banger](https://semianalysis.com/2025/04/23/amd-2-0-new-sense-of-urgency-mi450x-chance-to-beat-nvidia-nvidias-new-moat/) on “AMD 2.0”

* **M.W.** chose **A**: “the people in the backgrounds limbs seem off”

  * Pretty much everyone else who **chose A** was sussed out by the blur, like **M.L.B** who said: “The motion blur effect just doesn't look like a camera did it, something is off.”

* **Eagle eye mode: C.G.** chose **B:** “hair and jacket both show evidence of backlighting in B - but she is standing entirely in shadow.” [This is us right now](https://tenor.com/view/ohsnap-omg-rapbattle-burn-squad-gif-5222132).

###### OPENAI

#### 🎨 [_OpenAI unlocks powerful image creation via API_](https://openai.com/index/image-generation-api/)

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/4c0c4bdb-47bc-4a0c-abaa-ef7718c93d32/imageapi.jpg?t=1745437624)
Caption: Image source: OpenAI

**The Rundown: **OpenAI just [launched](https://openai.com/index/image-generation-api/) its advanced image generation model, gpt-image-1, to developers via API — bringing the viral success of ChatGPT's image capabilities to third-party applications and platforms.

**The details: **

* The gpt-image-1 model powers ChatGPT's image generation feature, which produced over 700 million images in just one week after its launch in March.

* The model enables high-quality image creation with varied styles, accurate text rendering, enhanced image editing, and more. 

* OpenAI revealed that major platforms, including Adobe, Figma, and Canva, are already integrating the technology for professional design workflows.

* Developers can also control the moderation level to tailor generated content safety, with standard "auto" filtering or less restrictive "low" moderation.

* Pricing is structured per token usage, with text prompts ($5 / 1M), input images ($10 / 1M), and output images ($40 / 1M), or ≈2-19c per image based on quality.

**Why it matters: **After ChatGPT's image generator went viral last month, OpenAI is positioning itself to power the next wave of AI-enhanced creative tools — and there will be a TON of them. The API release also deepens the broader creative ecosystem’s reliance on OpenAI, a position previously held by other rivals.

###### MICROSOFT

#### 🤖 [_Microsoft’s new AI agents, workplace AI research_](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/2025-the-year-the-frontier-firm-is-born)

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0b84bbfc-582f-47cd-81b5-d10e722d0064/agentboss.jpg?t=1745441894)
Caption: Image source: Microsoft

**The Rundown: **Microsoft just [released](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/03/25/introducing-researcher-and-analyst-in-microsoft-365-copilot/) two new Copilot agents, Researcher and Analyst, alongside its [2025 Work Trend Index report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/2025-the-year-the-frontier-firm-is-born) — which maps out the rise of AI-centric, human-led “Frontier Firms” set to reshape the workplace.

**The details:**

* Researcher and Analyst bring deep reasoning to M365 Copilot for complex research and data science tasks like forecasting.

* The agents are rolling out as part of Copilot’s “Frontier” early access program, alongside updates that let companies build autonomous multi-agent systems.

* Microsoft's research across 31,000 workers shows companies leading in AI adoption are seeing major results:

  * 71% report their company is thriving vs 37% globally

* 55% say they can handle increased workloads vs 20% globally

* Workers show higher optimism about career opportunities 

* Microsoft also believes that every employee will become an “agent boss,” with all companies becoming AI-human “Frontier Firms” for operations in 2-5 years.

**Why it matters: **Microsoft’s agent release coincides nicely with how the company views the future of work: one dominated by AI agents, but managed by humans. We’re in the beginning stages of a complete shift in how work gets done — with human-agent teams becoming the norm and companies moving to fully hybrid, AI-infused structures.

###### OPENAI VS. THE INDUSTRY

#### ❌ _[Ex-staff, experts challenge OpenAI's restructuring](https://notforprivategain.org/)_

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/25050f4a-92f5-40e2-b0f7-ea798e05902f/privategain.jpg?t=1745445281)
Caption: Image source: Not For Private Gain 

**The Rundown: **More than 30 AI experts and ex-OpenAI staffers [published](https://notforprivategain.org/) an open letter urging the attorneys general of Delaware and California to block OpenAI’s restructuring, warning it would undermine its original mission to benefit humanity.

**The details: **

* 9 former OpenAI employees joined notable figures like AI ‘godfather’ Geoffrey Hinton in calling to block the startup’s transition from nonprofit to for-profit.

* They argue the move will remove vital nonprofit oversight and safeguards, and redirect AGI development from public benefit to shareholder returns.

* OpenAI needs transition approval from both state AGs by year-end to secure a pending $40B SoftBank investment contingent on the restructuring.

* The letter follows an [earlier motion](https://www.therundown.ai/p/ilyas-ssi-skyrockets-to-32b) by 12 former employees seeking to weigh in on Elon Musk's [lawsuit](https://www.therundown.ai/p/musk-battles-openais-for-profit-push) against the company and CEO Sam Altman.

**Why it matters: **With billions in investments hanging in the balance and both former employees and AI heavyweights lining up against the AI leader, the opposition continues to mount against OpenAI’s for-profit shift — but we’ve seen little movement to suggest the transition is in jeopardy, despite the red flags being raised.

<div>
<a><img/></a>
</div><p>The ongoing antitrust trial against Google has opened new doors for innovation and competition in the tech landscape. OpenAI's expressed interest in acquiring Google's Chrome web browser marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of artificial intelligence and online browsing.</p>
<ul>
<li>The current trial phase involves remedies, with the DOJ advocating for the divestiture of Chrome, which has over 4.1 billion users, to bolster competition.</li>
<li>OpenAI's product manager, Nick Turley, testified that acquiring Chrome would facilitate the creation of an “AI-first browser,” allowing for the integration of AI technologies like ChatGPT to enhance user interaction with the web.</li>
<li>With Chrome’s extensive user base, OpenAI sees an opportunity to introduce innovative AI-driven features, such as personalized recommendations and conversational search, which could differentiate its browser from competitors and refine its AI models through direct user data access.</li>

<hr/><p><strong><mark>ROBOTAXI</mark></strong></p><h3>Tesla 2025 Earnings Call Showcases Musk’s Robotaxi Ambitions</h3>
<div>
<a><img/></a>
</div><p>During Tesla’s Q1 earnings call, CEO Elon Musk made one of his most ambitious predictions yet: “I predict that there will be millions of Teslas on autonomous driving – fully autonomous driving – in the second half of next year.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Tesla plans to launch a pilot for its robotaxi program with a limited fleet of 10 to 20 Model Y vehicles in Austin in June 2025, with the objective to scale rapidly after proving operational reliability.</li>
<li>The company distinguishes itself by relying primarily on camera-based vision and AI for its autonomous systems, contrasting with competitors that utilize a mix of sensors. This strategy allows for theoretically faster scaling as any Tesla with the right hardware can become a robotaxi through software updates.</li>
<li>Following the Austin pilot, Tesla aims to expand its robotaxi services nationwide by the end of 2025, while also planning to allow vehicle owners to join the network by 2026, creating a new income stream for users.</li>
<li>The current charging infrastructure may not support Musk's vision of millions of robotaxis, necessitating significant upgrades to both the Supercharger network and grid capacity to handle increased demand.</li>
<li>Tesla faces stiff competition from established players like Waymo and Zoox, which are already operational. The disappointment in Tesla's recent financial results adds pressure for the robotaxi program to succeed as a potential catalyst for future growth.</li>

OpenAI has introduced a cost\-efficient, lightweight version of its Deep Research feature for free\-tier ChatGPT users, offering up to five queries per month. This version runs on the o4\-mini model, providing comparable depth to the standard o3\-powered tool, though responses may be shorter. Paid users on Plus, Pro, and Team plans can access additional queries, with automatic fallback to o4\-mini once the o3 limit is exceeded.

In related updates, OpenAI's models continue to perform \[strongly](https://x.com/lmarena\_ai/status/1915078057452573142\) on the LMSYS Arena leaderboard, with the o3 model securing the \#2 spot and excelling in math, coding, and style control. The o4\-mini also ranks highly, particularly in mathematical tasks.

\[OpenAI’s Open Model to Invoke Cloud for Complex Queries](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/openai\-wants\-its\-open\-ai\-model\-to\-call\-models\-in\-the\-cloud\-for\-help/): OpenAI is set to release its first fully downloadable AI model in years, designed to outperform open\-source models from Meta and DeepSeek. Internally dubbed a “reasoning” model, it may feature an optional “handoff” capability, enabling it to invoke OpenAI’s larger, cloud\-hosted models for complex queries via API. 

The handoff concept, proposed by a developer during a community event, has reportedly gained traction within OpenAI. While the exact tools and pricing structure remain unclear, the company is training the model from scratch rather than adapting an existing one.

\[Revenue Projections: OpenAI Eyes $174B by 2030](https://the\-decoder.com/openai\-reportedly\-plans\-to\-grow\-revenue\-from\-4\-billion\-to\-174\-billion\-by\-2030/): OpenAI expects its revenue to grow from $4 billion in 2024 to $174 billion by 2030, driven by AI agents, new products, and monetization strategies. Agents like “Operator” could generate $29 billion by 2029, with $50B from subscriptions and $22B from APIs.

\[GPT\-Image\-1 API Launches for Developers](https://the\-decoder.com/openai\-adds\-chatgpt\-image\-model\-gpt\-image\-1\-to\-api\-for\-developers/): OpenAI has released its \[GPT\-Image\-1](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt\-image\-1\) model —originally integrated into ChatGPT—via API, expanding access to high\-fidelity image generation and analysis tools for developers. The model supports text\-to\-image synthesis with precise prompt alignment and image interpretation across PNG, JPEG, WEBP, and GIF formats. Input can be submitted via URL or Base64, with output resolution capped at 768×2000 pixels.

Youtube: OpenAI's New GPT Image Model API in 5 Minutes 📸 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\=k\-G71JZA75A)

Pricing is usage\-based: $5 per million tokens for text prompts, $10 for image inputs, and $40 for image outputs, with per\-image costs ranging from $0\.02 to $0\.19 depending on detail. Safety measures match ChatGPT\-4o, including C2PA metadata and content moderation, and API data is excluded from training.

\#\# \*\*Anthropic Targets AI Black Box Transparency and Welfare Research by 2027\*\*

Anthropic has launched a research program focused on AI "\[model welfare](https://www.anthropic.com/research/exploring\-model\-welfare)," investigating whether AI systems could experience human\-like traits such as distress or consciousness. This initiative follows a report co\-authored by philosopher David Chalmers, suggesting \[AI might develop consciousness and agency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411\.00986\). The research will explore the ethical implications of these possibilities, looking for signs of distress or preferences in AI models.

Youtube: Could AI models be conscious? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\=pyXouxa0WnY)

Led by Kyle Fish, the research will analyze both behavioral responses—such as how models react to choices—and internal mechanisms that could align with theories of consciousness. While no consensus exists on whether AI can achieve consciousness, Anthropic is proceeding cautiously, acknowledging the uncertainty in the field.

Additionally, CEO Dario Amodei has outlined plans to improve \[AI model interpretability by 2027](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/anthropic\-ceo\-wants\-to\-open\-the\-black\-box\-of\-ai\-models\-by\-2027/), urging the AI industry to ramp up efforts in mechanistic interpretability to mitigate risks of autonomous decision\-making.

\#\# \*\*Google’s Gemini Surpasses 350 Million Users, Gaining Ground on ChatGPT\*\*

Google has teamed up with HHMI Janelia and Harvard to release \[ZAPBench](https://research.google/blog/improving\-brain\-models\-with\-zapbench/), a comprehensive brain activity dataset aimed at refining predictive models of brain function. Capturing data from approximately 70,000 neurons in a larval zebrafish's brain, the dataset offers new insights into how neural activity correlates with brain structure. With ZAPBench, researchers can compare and enhance models that track brain activity over time. The next step will be incorporating a full connectome to increase model accuracy.

Tweet: (https://twitter.com/GoogleAI/status/1915454869248282651\)

Meanwhile, Google's Gemini chatbot has reached \[350 million active users](https://the\-decoder.com/googles\-gemini\-chatbot\-claims\-350\-million\-users\-but\-the\-true\-number\-may\-be\-much\-higher/), with the actual number likely higher due to its integration with platforms like Google Search and Android. While it still lags behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which has over 500 million weekly users, the latest Gemini 2\.5 Pro strengthens Google's position in the AI race. Notably, in today’s earnings call, Google revealed that \[over a third of all code generated ](https://x.com/AndrewCurran\_/status/1915533246072537555\)at the company is now produced by AI.

On the creative side, Google’s Music AI Sandbox has enhanced its features and expanded access for artists. The platform \[now includes Lyria 2](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/music\-ai\-sandbox\-now\-with\-new\-features\-and\-broader\-access/), an advanced music generation model offering high\-fidelity audio. Tools like "Create," "Extend," and "Edit" help artists explore genres and compose new tracks, while Lyria RealTime enables real\-time music creation.

A Founder Wants AI To Completely Replace Humans


 |  | | | 🛎️The Rise of Frontier Firms | | --- | | | By Magna Ding • 25 Apr 2025 | View in browser | | --- | --- | | View in browser | | | Good Morning, AI Enthusiasts!AI is quickly and significantly affecting corporate culture and organizational structure. We appear to be at a new turning point.   ---    ***SPONSORED BY***     ****AI Creation Space That Adapts to Your Mind****     ---  **TREND**  The Rise of Frontier Firms: AI Agents and the Future of Work   Microsoft’s latest research introduces the concept of “Frontier Firms,” where hybrid teams of humans and AI agents collaborate, reshaping productivity, management, and the future of work. It reports significant productivity improvements, including a 35% increase in task completion speed and a 28% boost in decision\-making accuracy, thanks to AI's data processing capabilities.* AI has transitioned from a mere tool to an active collaborator, now capable of understanding context and providing nuanced recommendations, fundamentally changing decision\-making dynamics. * These organizations are characterized by AI\-human collaboration, on\-demand intelligence generation, agile design in team structures, continuous learning, and a data\-driven culture. * Managers now oversee hybrid teams, necessitating technical literacy in AI, ethical oversight for AI operations, and adept change management to facilitate human\-AI collaboration.  The emergence of Frontier Firms signals a pivotal shift in the employment landscape. As organizations increasingly adopt hybrid AI\-human teams, we can expect a significant transformation in productivity and management practices. This evolution not only enhances operational efficiency but also redefines roles, positioning human workers to focus on creativity and complex problem\-solving.    | Read full story👉 | | --- |      ---  **TOGETHER WITH FLOWITH**  AI Creation Space That Adapts to Your Mind   Introducing Flowith: an AI agent so powerful, it could transform complex work into a playground of simplicity, delivering faster results and insights so deep!Perfect for content creators, researchers, and business professionals, Flowith doesn’t just organize your thoughts; it makes them dance!

Critics question Besiroglu's shift from ethical AI governance to a profit\-driven venture. * Supporters argue that full automation could lead to economic growth, higher living standards, and allow humans to pursue more creative and innovative endeavors, suggesting a cultural shift in the perception of work.  The emergence of Mechanize is a watershed moment in the conversation around AI and labor. As we stand at this crossroads, we must confront the dual\-edged sword that automation presents. While the economic advantages of a fully automated society are tantalizing, the potential fallout—job loss, increased inequality, and a crisis of purpose—cannot be overlooked.    | Read full story👉 | | --- |      ---  **QUICK HITS*** OpenAI has launched an API for its ChatGPT image generation model, allowing businesses to integrate high\-quality images into their platforms. * NTT Data Group partners with OpenAI to launch generative AI tools for businesses, emphasizing data security. * Trump signed an executive order to establish a task force and training grants aimed at enhancing AI education for students and educators in the U.S. * Intel has reportedly ordered TSMC's 2nm\-class N2 process technology for its upcoming Nova Lake CPUs. * A woman diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma credits ChatGPT for predicting her cancer a year prior to her official diagnosis.    ---  **TRENDING TOOLS*** 📶 StockMarketGPT is a ChatGPT for stock market investors. * 🔎 Andi is an AI search agent that can answer anything. * 🎶 Riffusion enables stable diffusion for real\-time music generation. * 🌐 Typedream AI builds \& launches your website in minutes with AI. * 🏷️ Logo Diffusion designs your Logo with AI. * 🪶 CopyOwl is the First AI Research Agent, deep research on any topic in one click. **(Featured)** * 📚 Heardly is the Fast Way to read Best Book. **(Featured)** * 🚀 Intellectia.ai is the most powerful AI platform for smarter investment. **(Featured)**    ---  1 Million\+ AI enthusiasts are eager to learn about your product.**AI Secret** is the world’s **\#1 AI Newsletter**, boasting over **1 million readers** from leading companies such as OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.

\*\*Good morning, AI enthusiasts.\*\* Anthropic just took the AI consciousness debate from science fiction to serious research — launching a new program to develop frameworks for assessing potential model welfare.

With their own researcher estimating a 15% chance that models are already conscious, are we nearing the existential debate on whether digital minds deserve ethical treatment?

\*\*The Rundown: \*\*Anthropic just \[launched](https://www.anthropic.com/research/exploring\-model\-welfare) a new research program dedicated to “model welfare,” exploring the complex ethical questions around whether future AI systems might gain consciousness or deserve moral consideration in the future.

\*\*The details: \*\*

\* Research areas include developing frameworks to assess consciousness, studying indicators of AI preferences and distress, and exploring interventions.

\* Anthropic hired its first AI welfare researcher, Kyle Fish, in 2024 to explore consciousness in AI — who estimates a 15% chance models are conscious.

\* The initiative follows increasing AI capabilities and a \[recent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411\.00986\) report (co\-authored by Fish) suggesting AI consciousness is a near\-term possibility.

\* Anthropic emphasized deep uncertainty around these questions, noting no scientific consensus on whether current or future systems could be conscious.

\*\*Why it matters: \*\*Sam Altman previously \[likened](https://x.com/tsarnick/status/1797104717040062558\) AI to a form of alien intelligence. Soon, these models may reach a level that changes how we understand consciousness and ethics about them. We’ll likely see a polarizing divide—especially since there’s no threshold for when an AI could be considered “conscious” or deserving of rights.

\*\*The Rundown: \*\*Adobe just \[launched](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/04/24/adobe\-firefly\-next\-evolution\-creative\-ai\-is\-here) a major expansion of its Firefly AI platform at its MAX London event, introducing two new powerful image generation models, third\-party integrations, a new collaborative workspace, and an upcoming mobile app.

\*\*The details:\*\*

\* The new Firefly Image Model 4 and 4 Ultra boost generation quality, realism, control, and speed, while supporting up to 2K resolution outputs.

\* Firefly's web app now offers access to third\-party models like OpenAI's GPT ImageGen, Google's Imagen 3 and Veo 2, and Black Forest Labs’ Flux 1\.1 Pro.

\* Firefly’s text\-to\-video capabilities are now out of beta, alongside the official release of its text\-to\-vector model.

\* Adobe also launched Firefly Boards in beta for collaborative AI moodboarding and announced the upcoming release of a new Firefly mobile app.

\* Adobe’s models are all commercially safe and IP\-friendly, with a new \[Content Authenticity](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/04/24/adobe\-content\-authenticity\-now\-public\-beta\-helps\-creators\-secure\-attribution) allowing users to easily apply AI\-identifying metadata to work.

\*\*Why it matters: \*\*OpenAI’s recent image generator and other rivals have shaken up creative workflows, but Adobe’s IP\-safe focus and the addition of competing models into Firefly allow professionals to remain in their established suite of tools — keeping users in the ecosystem while still having flexibility for other model strengths.

\*\*The Rundown: \*\*Google DeepMind just \[released](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/music\-ai\-sandbox\-now\-with\-new\-features\-and\-broader\-access/) new upgrades to its Music AI Sandbox, introducing its new Lyria 2 music generation model alongside new creation and editing features for professional musicians. 

\*\*The details: \*\*

\* The platform’s new “Create,” “Extend,” and “Edit” features allow musicians to generate tracks, continue musical ideas, and transform clips via text prompts.

\* The tools are powered by the upgraded Lyria 2 model, which features higher\-fidelity, professional\-grade audio generation compared to previous versions.

\* DeepMind also unveiled Lyria RealTime, a version of the model enabling interactive, real\-time music creation and control by blending styles on the fly.

\* Access to the experimental Music AI Sandbox is expanding to more musicians, songwriters, and producers in the U.S. for broader feedback and exploration.

\*\*Why it matters: \*\*Google is targeting professional musicians, positioning Lyria 2 and the Sandbox as co\-creation partners rather than just novelty music generators. The creative landscape for musicians is being reshaped by AI, like every other medium, but these tools are a big step in normalizing its currently polarizing use in the industry.

Financial management is a deeply personal and context\-sensitive domain where one\-size\-fits\-all AI solutions fall short. Building truly helpful AI financial advisors requires understanding the interplay between budgeting, saving, and debt management as interconnected rather than isolated concerns.

A multi\-agent system provides the perfect architecture for this approach, allowing us to craft specialized agents that collaborate rather than operate in silos, mirroring how human financial advisors actually work.

In this tutorial, we'll build a Multi\-Agent Personal Financial Coach application using \_\*\*\[Google’s newly released Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk\-docs/)\*\*\_ and the Gemini model. Our application will feature specialized agents for budget analysis, savings strategies, and debt reduction, working together to provide comprehensive financial advice. The system will offer actionable recommendations with interactive visualizations.

We share hands\-on tutorials like this every week, designed to help you stay ahead in the world of AI. \_\*\*\[If you're serious about leveling up your AI skills and staying ahead of the curve, subscribe now and be the first to access our latest tutorials.](https://www.theunwindai.com/subscribe)\*\*\_

Laminar AI has released \*\*Index\*\*, a new open\-source agent for automating complex tasks directly within a browser environment. Index operates by using a focused script combining JS, computer vision, and OCR to pinpoint interactable web elements, presenting them visually to powerful vision\-enabled LLMs for action.

It achieved a 92% score on the WebVoyager benchmark with Claude 3\.7 (extended thinking), outperforming OpenAI Operator (CUA), which scored 87%. Index also includes built\-in browser session replay and trace synchronization tailored for developer debugging. Available via a simple Python package, CLI, or API, Index integrates with leading models like Gemini 2\.5 Pro, Claude 3\.7, and OpenAI o4\-mini, offering flexibility for various use cases.

\*\*Key Highlights:\*\*

1\. \*\*Observability\*\* \- Index records complete browser sessions while tracking agent steps and LLM calls, then synchronizes everything in a unified interface. This debugging environment lets you see exactly what the agent perceives alongside execution traces, making it easier to identify and fix problems.

2\. \*\*Element Detection\*\* \- The core of Index is its carefully developed detection script, created through extensive testing. Combined with computer vision and OCR techniques, it accurately identifies interactive elements across different web interfaces.

3\. \*\*Architecture\*\* \- Index runs on a straightforward while loop powered by well\-crafted prompts. This approach, improved through thousands of evaluation runs, delivers strong performance with minimal complexity.

4\. \*\*Integration Options\*\* \- Get started quickly with a simple \`pip install lmnr\-index\` and run via Python code, an interactive CLI, or serverless API. The tool supports multiple LLMs like Gemini 2\.5 Pro/Flash, Claude 3\.7 Sonnet, and OpenAI o4\-min.

Welcome, humans. 

Required reading time! So, y'know how there's a backlash against “just putting AI everywhere” in products we use daily? YC Partner Pete Koomen \[just nailed ](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless\-carriages/)\[\_why\_](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless\-carriages/).

He says most current AI features are “\[horseless carriages](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless\-carriages/\#horseless\-carriages)”—they jam AI into old UIs instead of rebuilding for an AI\-first world. Using Gmail's clunky AI draft feature as exhibit A, Koomen shows how it takes MORE time than just writing the email yourself.

His key insight: YOU should control the System Prompt for any AI acting on your behalf. Most AI apps should be "agent builders," not pre\-configured agents. Example:

We'll take it further: \_everyone's too lazy to rebuild their codebase for AI—but that's exactly what's needed.\_ For AI to be actually useful, it needs to be able to actually do things for us. That’s why you’re seeing such an emphasis on \[“Computer use” agents](https://github.com/steel\-dev/awesome\-web\-agents) right now. 

\_We’ll literally teach AI how to use computers like humans do before we’ll give humans the tools to create actually useful AI apps. \_

The piece is packed with interactive demos showing how much better user\-controlled AI could be. Definitely worth the full read (and \[great discussion on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id\=43773813\)).

\*\*Here’s what you need to know about AI today:\*\*

\* Microsoft released a new Work Trend Index report.

\* OpenAI projected $174B in revenue by 2030\. 

\* Google's antitrust case revealed some wild facts. 

\* The US government ordered AI in K\-12 schools.

Is your company hiring AI agents as employees? According to Microsoft's new \[Work Trend Index report](https://www.microsoft.com/en\-us/worklab/work\-trend\-index/2025\-the\-year\-the\-frontier\-firm\-is\-born), that's exactly what leading companies are doing in 2025\.

Microsoft analyzed data from 31K workers across 31 countries and found the emergence of a new kind of organization they're calling the “Frontier Firm”—companies powered by intelligence on tap and hybrid teams of humans and AI agents.

In a one\-on\-one chat with Microsoft’s Chief Marketing Officer, AI at Work\[ Jared Spataro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredspa), he told us that after studying AI\-native firms for a year and a half, they've observed a significant shift from employees caring about AI to employers driving AI adoption.

\*\*The research highlights three major shifts happening right now:\*\*

1\. \*\*Intelligence is becoming a utility you can purchase.\*\* With 82% of leaders planning to use AI agents in the next 12\-18 months, “digital labor” is becoming as essential as electricity. 

 1\. \*\*The need is clear:\*\* 53% of leaders say productivity must increase, but 80% of workers lack the time or energy to deliver more.

2\. \*\*Human\-agent teams are replacing traditional org charts.\*\* Nearly half of leaders say they're already using agents to fully automate workflows. 

 1\. This is creating what Microsoft calls a “Work Chart”—where teams form around goals rather than functions.

3\. \*\*Everyone's becoming an “agent boss.”\*\* The most valuable skill now is managing AI agents, not just using them. 

 1\. Leaders are ahead of employees here–67% of leaders are familiar with agents versus just 40% of employees.

\*\*The report shares some impressive real\-world results, too: \*\*

\* Wells Fargo built an agent for 35K bankers, cutting query time from 10 minutes to 30 seconds.

\* Dow created agents to find hidden shipping losses, expecting to save millions.

\* Bayer's researchers each save 6 hours weekly using agents.

\*\*The secret to success?\*\* Spataro revealed that high\-quality input is crucial: “One little\-known secret is grounding agents on really high\-quality input content.” He advises creating really good briefs for projects and using the agents to scale out. 

\*\*This caused us to ask: \*\*What makes a good brief? It turns out, the same things that make a good prompt! 

\*\*Get this: \*\*Spataro also shared his \#1 piece of advice for anyone looking to add “Agent Boss” to their resume. \_Spoiler alert: start getting your hands dirty. \_

\# Prompt Tip of the Day

Everyone’s concerned about AI taking jobs, so \[here’s a prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1k2vluo/this\_one\_prompt\_turned\_my\_resume\_into\_a\_job/) to use AI to help you GET a job. There’s also \[this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1k2vluo/comment/mnxa172/?utm\_source\=share\&utm\_medium\=web3x\&utm\_name\=web3xcss\&utm\_term\=1\&utm\_content\=share\_button), an alternate version shared in the comments. 

The poster CLAIMS they used this (and had TikTok followers reply that it helped them get a job), but no guarantees. Either way, it’s probably a good starting point to help you update your resume if you don’t have any other resources!

\*\*The Rundown: \*\*OpenAI just \[launched](https://openai.com/index/image\-generation\-api/) its advanced image generation model, gpt\-image\-1, to developers via API — bringing the viral success of ChatGPT's image capabilities to third\-party applications and platforms.

\*\*The details: \*\*

\* The gpt\-image\-1 model powers ChatGPT's image generation feature, which produced over 700 million images in just one week after its launch in March.

\* The model enables high\-quality image creation with varied styles, accurate text rendering, enhanced image editing, and more. 

\* OpenAI revealed that major platforms, including Adobe, Figma, and Canva, are already integrating the technology for professional design workflows.

\* Developers can also control the moderation level to tailor generated content safety, with standard "auto" filtering or less restrictive "low" moderation.

\* Pricing is structured per token usage, with text prompts ($5 / 1M), input images ($10 / 1M), and output images ($40 / 1M), or ≈2\-19c per image based on quality.

\*\*Why it matters: \*\*After ChatGPT's image generator went viral last month, OpenAI is positioning itself to power the next wave of AI\-enhanced creative tools — and there will be a TON of them. The API release also deepens the broader creative ecosystem’s reliance on OpenAI, a position previously held by other rivals.

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn\-cgi/image/fit\=scale\-down,format\=auto,onerror\=redirect,quality\=80/uploads/asset/file/0b84bbfc\-582f\-47cd\-81b5\-d10e722d0064/agentboss.jpg?t\=1745441894\)

\*\*The Rundown: \*\*Microsoft just \[released](https://www.microsoft.com/en\-us/microsoft\-365/blog/2025/03/25/introducing\-researcher\-and\-analyst\-in\-microsoft\-365\-copilot/) two new Copilot agents, Researcher and Analyst, alongside its \[2025 Work Trend Index report](https://www.microsoft.com/en\-us/worklab/work\-trend\-index/2025\-the\-year\-the\-frontier\-firm\-is\-born) — which maps out the rise of AI\-centric, human\-led “Frontier Firms” set to reshape the workplace.

\*\*The details:\*\*

\* Researcher and Analyst bring deep reasoning to M365 Copilot for complex research and data science tasks like forecasting.

\* The agents are rolling out as part of Copilot’s “Frontier” early access program, alongside updates that let companies build autonomous multi\-agent systems.

\* Microsoft's research across 31,000 workers shows companies leading in AI adoption are seeing major results:

 \* 71% report their company is thriving vs 37% globally

\* 55% say they can handle increased workloads vs 20% globally

\* Workers show higher optimism about career opportunities 

\* Microsoft also believes that every employee will become an “agent boss,” with all companies becoming AI\-human “Frontier Firms” for operations in 2\-5 years.

\*\*Why it matters: \*\*Microsoft’s agent release coincides nicely with how the company views the future of work: one dominated by AI agents, but managed by humans. We’re in the beginning stages of a complete shift in how work gets done — with human\-agent teams becoming the norm and companies moving to fully hybrid, AI\-infused structures.

\#\#\#\#\#\# OPENAI VS. THE INDUSTRY

\#\#\#\# ❌ \_\[Ex\-staff, experts challenge OpenAI's restructuring](https://notforprivategain.org/)\_

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn\-cgi/image/fit\=scale\-down,format\=auto,onerror\=redirect,quality\=80/uploads/asset/file/25050f4a\-92f5\-40e2\-b0f7\-ea798e05902f/privategain.jpg?t\=1745445281\)
Caption: Image source: Not For Private Gain 

\*\*The Rundown: \*\*More than 30 AI experts and ex\-OpenAI staffers \[published](https://notforprivategain.org/) an open letter urging the attorneys general of Delaware and California to block OpenAI’s restructuring, warning it would undermine its original mission to benefit humanity.

\*\*The details: \*\*

\* 9 former OpenAI employees joined notable figures like AI ‘godfather’ Geoffrey Hinton in calling to block the startup’s transition from nonprofit to for\-profit.

\* They argue the move will remove vital nonprofit oversight and safeguards, and redirect AGI development from public benefit to shareholder returns.

\* OpenAI needs transition approval from both state AGs by year\-end to secure a pending $40B SoftBank investment contingent on the restructuring.

\* The letter follows an \[earlier motion](https://www.therundown.ai/p/ilyas\-ssi\-skyrockets\-to\-32b) by 12 former employees seeking to weigh in on Elon Musk's \[lawsuit](https://www.therundown.ai/p/musk\-battles\-openais\-for\-profit\-push) against the company and CEO Sam Altman.

\*\*Why it matters: \*\*With billions in investments hanging in the balance and both former employees and AI heavyweights lining up against the AI leader, the opposition continues to mount against OpenAI’s for\-profit shift — but we’ve seen little movement to suggest the transition is in jeopardy, despite the red flags being raised.

This strategy allows for theoretically faster scaling as any Tesla with the right hardware can become a robotaxi through software updates. * Following the Austin pilot, Tesla aims to expand its robotaxi services nationwide by the end of 2025, while also planning to allow vehicle owners to join the network by 2026, creating a new income stream for users. * The current charging infrastructure may not support Musk's vision of millions of robotaxis, necessitating significant upgrades to both the Supercharger network and grid capacity to handle increased demand. * Tesla faces stiff competition from established players like Waymo and Zoox, which are already operational. The disappointment in Tesla's recent financial results adds pressure for the robotaxi program to succeed as a potential catalyst for future growth.      | Read full story👉 | | --- |      ---  **QUICK HITS*** Intel is set to announce layoffs of over 21,000 employees, representing 20% of its workforce, this week. * SK Hynix has overtaken Samsung to become the world's leading DRAM chip vendor, driven by strong demand for AI technology. * BMW plans to integrate DeepSeek in its new vehicles in China starting later this year. * Noxtua raises $92 million to develop a sovereign AI tailored for the German legal system. * Chinese internet giants ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent have stockpiled billions in Nvidia's H20 chips ahead of new U.S. export restrictions.    ---  **TRENDING TOOLS*** 💾 Adverity brings conversational AI to data—get insights instantly, automate reporting, and save time. * 📺 Blotato creates 10x more content with AI. * 🔊 Music.AI powers your music project. * 📁 Creator Supply offers inspiring framer templates. * 🎓 StudyFetch creates your course material in seconds. * 🪶 CopyOwl is the First AI Research Agent, deep research on any topic in one click. **(Featured)** * 📚 Heardly is the Fast Way to read Best Book. **(Featured)** * 🚀 Intellectia.ai is the most powerful AI platform for smarter investment. **(Featured)** * 🔎 Accio is the First AI Sourcing Engine for products and B2B insights.**(Featured)**    ---  1 Million\+ AI enthusiasts are eager to learn about your product.**AI Secret** is the world’s **\#1 AI Newsletter**, boasting over **1 million readers** from leading companies such as OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.

OpenAI has introduced a cost-efficient, lightweight version of its Deep Research feature for free-tier ChatGPT users, offering up to five queries per month. This version runs on the o4-mini model, providing comparable depth to the standard o3-powered tool, though responses may be shorter. Paid users on Plus, Pro, and Team plans can access additional queries, with automatic fallback to o4-mini once the o3 limit is exceeded.

In related updates, OpenAI's models continue to perform [strongly](https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1915078057452573142) on the LMSYS Arena leaderboard, with the o3 model securing the #2 spot and excelling in math, coding, and style control. The o4-mini also ranks highly, particularly in mathematical tasks.

[OpenAI’s Open Model to Invoke Cloud for Complex Queries](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/openai-wants-its-open-ai-model-to-call-models-in-the-cloud-for-help/): OpenAI is set to release its first fully downloadable AI model in years, designed to outperform open-source models from Meta and DeepSeek. Internally dubbed a “reasoning” model, it may feature an optional “handoff” capability, enabling it to invoke OpenAI’s larger, cloud-hosted models for complex queries via API. 

The handoff concept, proposed by a developer during a community event, has reportedly gained traction within OpenAI. While the exact tools and pricing structure remain unclear, the company is training the model from scratch rather than adapting an existing one.

[Revenue Projections: OpenAI Eyes $174B by 2030](https://the-decoder.com/openai-reportedly-plans-to-grow-revenue-from-4-billion-to-174-billion-by-2030/): OpenAI expects its revenue to grow from $4 billion in 2024 to $174 billion by 2030, driven by AI agents, new products, and monetization strategies. Agents like “Operator” could generate $29 billion by 2029, with $50B from subscriptions and $22B from APIs.

[GPT-Image-1 API Launches for Developers](https://the-decoder.com/openai-adds-chatgpt-image-model-gpt-image-1-to-api-for-developers/): OpenAI has released its [GPT-Image-1](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-image-1) model —originally integrated into ChatGPT—via API, expanding access to high-fidelity image generation and analysis tools for developers. The model supports text-to-image synthesis with precise prompt alignment and image interpretation across PNG, JPEG, WEBP, and GIF formats. Input can be submitted via URL or Base64, with output resolution capped at 768×2000 pixels.

Pricing is usage-based: $5 per million tokens for text prompts, $10 for image inputs, and $40 for image outputs, with per-image costs ranging from $0.02 to $0.19 depending on detail. Safety measures match ChatGPT-4o, including C2PA metadata and content moderation, and API data is excluded from training.

## **Anthropic Targets AI Black Box Transparency and Welfare Research by 2027**

Anthropic has launched a research program focused on AI "[model welfare](https://www.anthropic.com/research/exploring-model-welfare)," investigating whether AI systems could experience human-like traits such as distress or consciousness. This initiative follows a report co-authored by philosopher David Chalmers, suggesting [AI might develop consciousness and agency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00986). The research will explore the ethical implications of these possibilities, looking for signs of distress or preferences in AI models.

Youtube: Could AI models be conscious? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXouxa0WnY)

Led by Kyle Fish, the research will analyze both behavioral responses—such as how models react to choices—and internal mechanisms that could align with theories of consciousness. While no consensus exists on whether AI can achieve consciousness, Anthropic is proceeding cautiously, acknowledging the uncertainty in the field.

Additionally, CEO Dario Amodei has outlined plans to improve [AI model interpretability by 2027](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/anthropic-ceo-wants-to-open-the-black-box-of-ai-models-by-2027/), urging the AI industry to ramp up efforts in mechanistic interpretability to mitigate risks of autonomous decision-making.

## **Google’s Gemini Surpasses 350 Million Users, Gaining Ground on ChatGPT**

Google has teamed up with HHMI Janelia and Harvard to release [ZAPBench](https://research.google/blog/improving-brain-models-with-zapbench/), a comprehensive brain activity dataset aimed at refining predictive models of brain function. Capturing data from approximately 70,000 neurons in a larval zebrafish's brain, the dataset offers new insights into how neural activity correlates with brain structure. With ZAPBench, researchers can compare and enhance models that track brain activity over time. The next step will be incorporating a full connectome to increase model accuracy.

Tweet:  (https://twitter.com/GoogleAI/status/1915454869248282651)

Meanwhile, Google's Gemini chatbot has reached [350 million active users](https://the-decoder.com/googles-gemini-chatbot-claims-350-million-users-but-the-true-number-may-be-much-higher/), with the actual number likely higher due to its integration with platforms like Google Search and Android. While it still lags behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which has over 500 million weekly users, the latest Gemini 2.5 Pro strengthens Google's position in the AI race. Notably, in today’s earnings call, Google revealed that [over a third of all code generated ](https://x.com/AndrewCurran_/status/1915533246072537555)at the company is now produced by AI.

On the creative side, Google’s Music AI Sandbox has enhanced its features and expanded access for artists. The platform [now includes Lyria 2](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/music-ai-sandbox-now-with-new-features-and-broader-access/), an advanced music generation model offering high-fidelity audio. Tools like "Create," "Extend," and "Edit" help artists explore genres and compose new tracks, while Lyria RealTime enables real-time music creation.

<hr/><p><strong><mark>TREND</mark></strong></p><h3>The Rise of Frontier Firms: AI Agents and the Future of Work</h3>
<div>
<a><img/></a>
</div><p>Microsoft’s latest research introduces the concept of “Frontier Firms,” where hybrid teams of humans and AI agents collaborate, reshaping productivity, management, and the future of work. It reports significant productivity improvements, including a 35% increase in task completion speed and a 28% boost in decision-making accuracy, thanks to AI's data processing capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>AI has transitioned from a mere tool to an active collaborator, now capable of understanding context and providing nuanced recommendations, fundamentally changing decision-making dynamics.</li>
<li>These organizations are characterized by AI-human collaboration, on-demand intelligence generation, agile design in team structures, continuous learning, and a data-driven culture.</li>
<li>Managers now oversee hybrid teams, necessitating technical literacy in AI, ethical oversight for AI operations, and adept change management to facilitate human-AI collaboration.</li>
</ul><p>The emergence of Frontier Firms signals a pivotal shift in the employment landscape. As organizations increasingly adopt hybrid AI-human teams, we can expect a significant transformation in productivity and management practices. This evolution not only enhances operational efficiency but also redefines roles, positioning human workers to focus on creativity and complex problem-solving.</p><p></p>

<hr/><p><strong><mark>CROSSROADS</mark></strong></p><h3>A Founder Wants AI To Completely Replace Humans</h3>
<div>
<a><img/></a>
</div><p>The launch of Mechanize by AI researcher Tamay Besiroglu has ignited a fierce debate about the future of work, automation, and the ethical implications of replacing human labor with artificial intelligence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Besiroglu aims for "full automation of the economy" through AI systems capable of performing all human jobs, starting with customer support and financial services, highlighting a market potential of $60 trillion.</li>
<li>The announcement has provoked extensive criticism, particularly regarding job displacement, economic inequality, and the erosion of human purpose. Critics question Besiroglu's shift from ethical AI governance to a profit-driven venture.</li>
<li>Supporters argue that full automation could lead to economic growth, higher living standards, and allow humans to pursue more creative and innovative endeavors, suggesting a cultural shift in the perception of work.</li>
</ul><p>The emergence of Mechanize is a watershed moment in the conversation around AI and labor. As we stand at this crossroads, we must confront the dual-edged sword that automation presents. While the economic advantages of a fully automated society are tantalizing, the potential fallout—job loss, increased inequality, and a crisis of purpose—cannot be overlooked.</p><p></p>

**Good morning, AI enthusiasts.** Anthropic just took the AI consciousness debate from science fiction to serious research — launching a new program to develop frameworks for assessing potential model welfare.

With their own researcher estimating a 15% chance that models are already conscious, are we nearing the existential debate on whether digital minds deserve ethical treatment?

———————————————————————————

**In today’s AI rundown:**

* Anthropic’s new research explores AI welfare

* Adobe’s new Firefly models, AI integrations

* Turn your terminal into an AI coding assistant

* Google DeepMind expands Music AI Sandbox

* 4 new AI tools &amp; 4 job opportunities

**The Rundown: **Anthropic just [launched](https://www.anthropic.com/research/exploring-model-welfare) a new research program dedicated to “model welfare,” exploring the complex ethical questions around whether future AI systems might gain consciousness or deserve moral consideration in the future.

**The details: **

* Research areas include developing frameworks to assess consciousness, studying indicators of AI preferences and distress, and exploring interventions.

* Anthropic hired its first AI welfare researcher, Kyle Fish, in 2024 to explore consciousness in AI — who estimates a 15% chance models are conscious.

* The initiative follows increasing AI capabilities and a [recent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00986) report (co-authored by Fish) suggesting AI consciousness is a near-term possibility.

* Anthropic emphasized deep uncertainty around these questions, noting no scientific consensus on whether current or future systems could be conscious.

**Why it matters: **Sam Altman previously [likened](https://x.com/tsarnick/status/1797104717040062558) AI to a form of alien intelligence. Soon, these models may reach a level that changes how we understand consciousness and ethics about them. We’ll likely see a polarizing divide—especially since there’s no  threshold for when an AI could be considered “conscious” or deserving of rights.

###### ADOBE

**The Rundown: **Adobe just [launched](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/04/24/adobe-firefly-next-evolution-creative-ai-is-here) a major expansion of its Firefly AI platform at its MAX London event, introducing two new powerful image generation models, third-party integrations, a new collaborative workspace, and an upcoming mobile app.

**The details:**

* The new Firefly Image Model 4 and 4 Ultra boost generation quality, realism, control, and speed, while supporting up to 2K resolution outputs.

* Firefly's web app now offers access to third-party models like OpenAI's GPT ImageGen, Google's Imagen 3 and Veo 2, and Black Forest Labs’ Flux 1.1 Pro.

* Firefly’s text-to-video capabilities are now out of beta, alongside the official release of its text-to-vector model.

* Adobe also launched Firefly Boards in beta for collaborative AI moodboarding and announced the upcoming release of a new Firefly mobile app.

* Adobe’s models are all commercially safe and IP-friendly, with a new [Content Authenticity](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/04/24/adobe-content-authenticity-now-public-beta-helps-creators-secure-attribution) allowing users to easily apply AI-identifying metadata to work.

**Why it matters: **OpenAI’s recent image generator and other rivals have shaken up creative workflows, but Adobe’s IP-safe focus and the addition of competing models into Firefly allow professionals to remain in their established suite of tools — keeping users in the ecosystem while still having flexibility for other model strengths.

**The Rundown: **Google DeepMind just [released](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/music-ai-sandbox-now-with-new-features-and-broader-access/) new upgrades to its Music AI Sandbox, introducing its new Lyria 2 music generation model alongside new creation and editing features for professional musicians. 

**The details: **

* The platform’s new “Create,” “Extend,” and “Edit” features allow musicians to generate tracks, continue musical ideas, and transform clips via text prompts.

* The tools are powered by the upgraded Lyria 2 model, which features higher-fidelity, professional-grade audio generation compared to previous versions.

* DeepMind also unveiled Lyria RealTime, a version of the model enabling interactive, real-time music creation and control by blending styles on the fly.

* Access to the experimental Music AI Sandbox is expanding to more musicians, songwriters, and producers in the U.S. for broader feedback and exploration.

**Why it matters: **Google is targeting professional musicians, positioning Lyria 2 and the Sandbox as co-creation partners rather than just novelty music generators. The creative landscape for musicians is being reshaped by AI, like every other medium, but these tools are a big step in normalizing its currently polarizing use in the industry.

## **AI Tutorial **


----------

----------
Financial management is a deeply personal and context-sensitive domain where one-size-fits-all AI solutions fall short. Building truly helpful AI financial advisors requires understanding the interplay between budgeting, saving, and debt management as interconnected rather than isolated concerns.

A multi-agent system provides the perfect architecture for this approach, allowing us to craft specialized agents that collaborate rather than operate in silos, mirroring how human financial advisors actually work.

In this tutorial, we'll build a Multi-Agent Personal Financial Coach application using _**[Google’s newly released Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)**_ and the Gemini model. Our application will feature specialized agents for budget analysis, savings strategies, and debt reduction, working together to provide comprehensive financial advice. The system will offer actionable recommendations with interactive visualizations.

We share hands-on tutorials like this every week, designed to help you stay ahead in the world of AI. _**[If you're serious about leveling up your AI skills and staying ahead of the curve, subscribe now and be the first to access our latest tutorials.](https://www.theunwindai.com/subscribe)**_

## **Quick Bites **


----------

----------
[**OpenAI has released its image generation capabilities worldwide in the API**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation) with gpt-image-1. The new model offers enhanced features including higher fidelity images, diverse visual styles, precise editing capabilities, rich world knowledge integration, and consistent text rendering. You can now access these capabilities through dedicated endpoints for image generation and editing, with additional support for the Responses API coming soon.



[**Groq has launched Groq Desktop, a new MCP host**](https://github.com/groq/groq-desktop-beta) that brings lightning-fast tool use to local models like Llama 4 Scout and Qwen QwQ 32B. Unlike Claude Desktop, which can lag with tool calls, Groq Desktop connects to any MCP server and returns results in seconds — even when models fetch files or trigger APIs. It’s already in beta, supports local chat with image inputs, and works with all MCP-compatible models running on Groq.



[**Agno unveils Memory 2.0 for its agent ecosystem**](https://docs.agno.com/agents/memory), providing multi-user and multi-session memory capabilities similar to ChatGPT but designed specifically for AI agents. The new system offers three memory types - session storage for conversation history, user memories for personalization, and session summaries for condensing lengthy interactions - all now available as the default memory driver for all Agno Agents.



[**Perplexity has finally rolled out its Voice Assistant feature to iOS users**](https://x.com/perplexity_ai/status/1915064472391336071), enabling iPhone owners to perform tasks across multiple apps through natural language commands. The assistant can now help users book reservations, manage calendar events, draft emails, play media content, and navigate ride-sharing services—all while maintaining conversations even when users switch between apps.


----------

----------
## **Tools of the Trade **


----------

----------
1. **[MCP MCP](https://mcpmcp.io/)** - An MCP server to discover MCP servers from any MCP client like Claude desktop or Cursor. Just use prompts like “which MCP server will help me manage my calendar,” and it’ll give you a list of available MCP servers.

2. **[Astral.now](https://Astral.now)**: Build web-browsing AI agents that automate marketing workflows. These agents execute defined steps like searching platforms, evaluating content with AI, and generating targeted replies to find potential leads. 

3. **[Scira MCP Chat](https://github.com/zaidmukaddam/scira-mcp-chat)**: Opensource minimalist web client that connects to any MCP server using Composio, Zapier, or your own setup. It supports multiple models (like Grok-3, GPT-4.1 Mini), has built-in reasoning support, and is built with Next.js, Tailwind, and Vercel’s AI SDK — no auth needed, full chat history included.

4. **[Awesome LLM Apps](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps)**: Build awesome LLM apps with RAG, AI agents, and more to interact with data sources like GitHub, Gmail, PDFs, and YouTube videos, and automate complex work.

## **Hot Takes **


----------

----------
1. OpenAI tried to acquire Cursor at $300M ARR but they chose to say no and raise at $10B.  
Then they offered Windsurf $3B as they hit $100M ARR.   
The model labs clearly want to buy breakout apps built on them. ~

Welcome, humans. 

Required reading time! So, y'know how there's a backlash against “just putting AI everywhere” in products we use daily? YC Partner Pete Koomen [just nailed ](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless-carriages/)[_why_](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless-carriages/).

He says most current AI features are “[horseless carriages](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless-carriages/#horseless-carriages)”—they jam AI into old UIs instead of rebuilding for an AI-first world. Using Gmail's clunky AI draft feature as exhibit A, Koomen shows how it takes MORE time than just writing the email yourself.

His key insight: YOU should control the System Prompt for any AI acting on your behalf. Most AI apps should be "agent builders," not pre-configured agents. Example:

We'll take it further: _everyone's too lazy to rebuild their codebase for AI—but that's exactly what's needed._ For AI to be actually useful, it needs to be able to actually do things for us. That’s why you’re seeing such an emphasis on [“Computer use” agents](https://github.com/steel-dev/awesome-web-agents) right now. 

_We’ll literally teach AI how to use computers like humans do before we’ll give humans the tools to create actually useful AI apps. _

The piece is packed with interactive demos showing how much better user-controlled AI could be. Definitely worth the full read (and [great discussion on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43773813)).

**Here’s what you need to know about AI today:**

* Microsoft released a new Work Trend Index report.

* OpenAI projected $174B in revenue by 2030. 

* Google's antitrust case revealed some wild facts. 

* The US government ordered AI in K-12 schools.

# Microsoft says we're in “The Year of the Frontier Firm”... but what does that ACTUALLY mean?

Is your company hiring AI agents as employees? According to Microsoft's new [Work Trend Index report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/2025-the-year-the-frontier-firm-is-born), that's exactly what leading companies are doing in 2025.

Microsoft analyzed data from 31K workers across 31 countries and found the emergence of a new kind of organization they're calling the “Frontier Firm”—companies powered by intelligence on tap and hybrid teams of humans and AI agents.

In a one-on-one chat with Microsoft’s Chief Marketing Officer, AI at Work[ Jared Spataro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredspa), he told us that after studying AI-native firms for a year and a half, they've observed a significant shift from employees caring about AI to employers driving AI adoption.

**The research highlights three major shifts happening right now:**

1. **Intelligence is becoming a utility you can purchase.** With 82% of leaders planning to use AI agents in the next 12-18 months, “digital labor” is becoming as essential as electricity. 

  1. **The need is clear:** 53% of leaders say productivity must increase, but 80% of workers lack the time or energy to deliver more.

2. **Human-agent teams are replacing traditional org charts.** Nearly half of leaders say they're already using agents to fully automate workflows. 

  1. This is creating what Microsoft calls a “Work Chart”—where teams form around goals rather than functions.

3. **Everyone's becoming an “agent boss.”** The most valuable skill now is managing AI agents, not just using them. 

  1. Leaders are ahead of employees here–67% of leaders are familiar with agents versus just 40% of employees.

**The report shares some impressive real-world results, too: **

* Wells Fargo built an agent for 35K bankers, cutting query time from 10 minutes to 30 seconds.

* Dow created agents to find hidden shipping losses, expecting to save millions.

* Bayer's researchers each save 6 hours weekly using agents.

**The secret to success?** Spataro revealed that high-quality input is crucial: “One little-known secret is grounding agents on really high-quality input content.” He advises creating really good briefs for projects and using the agents to scale out. 

**This caused us to ask: **What makes a good brief? It turns out, the same things that make a good prompt! 

**Get this: **Spataro also shared his #1 piece of advice for anyone looking to add “Agent Boss” to their resume. _Spoiler alert: start getting your hands dirty. _

# Prompt Tip of the Day

Everyone’s concerned about AI taking jobs, so [here’s a prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1k2vluo/this_one_prompt_turned_my_resume_into_a_job/) to use AI to help you GET a job. There’s also [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1k2vluo/comment/mnxa172/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button), an alternate version shared in the comments. 

The poster CLAIMS they used this (and had TikTok followers reply that it helped them get a job), but no guarantees. Either way, it’s probably a good starting point to help you update your resume if you don’t have any other resources!

# Around the Horn.

* [Sam Altman said on X](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless-carriages/) that OpenAI doubled the rate limits for o3 and o4-mini-high for Plus subscribers, and that the [OpenAI](https://x.com/sama/status/1915110344894435587)_[ imagen](https://x.com/sama/status/1915110344894435587)_ (_pass it on!_) is now available via API with special controls for moderation sensitivity, quality, speed, background, output format, and more for $5/1M text or $10/1M image input and $40/1M image output, so [~2-19 cents per image](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/openai-makes-its-upgraded-image-generator-available-to-developers/) ([docs here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation?image-generation-model=gpt-image-1)). 

* [OpenAI](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-forecasts-revenue-topping-125-billion-2029-agents-new-products-gain?rc=lks9on) forecasted $125B in revenue by 2029 and $174B by 2030, but get this: it expects the majority of this revenue to come from agents and new products, not ChatGPT alone. 

* [The US government](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/23/trump-order-artificial-intelligence-schools-ai/83230792007/) will now integrate AI into K-12 education, establish AI courses for students, and create a White House Task Force on AI Education.

* There’s a ton of juicy data coming out of Google’s antitrust court case right now: 

  * Like how Google’s contract w/ Motorola [apparently blocked the company](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/perplexity-executive-says-google-blocked-motorola-s-use-of-ai-assistant?embedded-checkout=true) from making Perplexity the default AI assistant on its devices…

* Or how [Gemini’s chatbot](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/googles-gemini-user-numbers-revealed-court) has about 35M daily active users and 350 monthly active users last month (vs 160M daily and 600M monthly for GPT)… 

* …And how ChatGPT has scooped up some “[homework and math](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/chatgpt-cannibalizing-google-search-commercial-queries)” search queries from Google, but not the profitable ones (like searches where someone wants to buy something)… _yet. _

**The Rundown: **OpenAI just [launched](https://openai.com/index/image-generation-api/) its advanced image generation model, gpt-image-1, to developers via API — bringing the viral success of ChatGPT's image capabilities to third-party applications and platforms.

**The details: **

* The gpt-image-1 model powers ChatGPT's image generation feature, which produced over 700 million images in just one week after its launch in March.

* The model enables high-quality image creation with varied styles, accurate text rendering, enhanced image editing, and more. 

* OpenAI revealed that major platforms, including Adobe, Figma, and Canva, are already integrating the technology for professional design workflows.

* Developers can also control the moderation level to tailor generated content safety, with standard "auto" filtering or less restrictive "low" moderation.

* Pricing is structured per token usage, with text prompts ($5 / 1M), input images ($10 / 1M), and output images ($40 / 1M), or ≈2-19c per image based on quality.

**Why it matters: **After ChatGPT's image generator went viral last month, OpenAI is positioning itself to power the next wave of AI-enhanced creative tools — and there will be a TON of them. The API release also deepens the broader creative ecosystem’s reliance on OpenAI, a position previously held by other rivals.

#### 🤖 [_Microsoft’s new AI agents, workplace AI research_](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/2025-the-year-the-frontier-firm-is-born)

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0b84bbfc-582f-47cd-81b5-d10e722d0064/agentboss.jpg?t=1745441894)

**The Rundown: **Microsoft just [released](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/03/25/introducing-researcher-and-analyst-in-microsoft-365-copilot/) two new Copilot agents, Researcher and Analyst, alongside its [2025 Work Trend Index report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/2025-the-year-the-frontier-firm-is-born) — which maps out the rise of AI-centric, human-led “Frontier Firms” set to reshape the workplace.

**The details:**

* Researcher and Analyst bring deep reasoning to M365 Copilot for complex research and data science tasks like forecasting.

* The agents are rolling out as part of Copilot’s “Frontier” early access program, alongside updates that let companies build autonomous multi-agent systems.

* Microsoft's research across 31,000 workers shows companies leading in AI adoption are seeing major results:

  * 71% report their company is thriving vs 37% globally

* 55% say they can handle increased workloads vs 20% globally

* Workers show higher optimism about career opportunities 

* Microsoft also believes that every employee will become an “agent boss,” with all companies becoming AI-human “Frontier Firms” for operations in 2-5 years.

**Why it matters: **Microsoft’s agent release coincides nicely with how the company views the future of work: one dominated by AI agents, but managed by humans. We’re in the beginning stages of a complete shift in how work gets done — with human-agent teams becoming the norm and companies moving to fully hybrid, AI-infused structures.

###### OPENAI VS. THE INDUSTRY

#### ❌ _[Ex-staff, experts challenge OpenAI's restructuring](https://notforprivategain.org/)_

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/25050f4a-92f5-40e2-b0f7-ea798e05902f/privategain.jpg?t=1745445281)
Caption: Image source: Not For Private Gain 

**The Rundown: **More than 30 AI experts and ex-OpenAI staffers [published](https://notforprivategain.org/) an open letter urging the attorneys general of Delaware and California to block OpenAI’s restructuring, warning it would undermine its original mission to benefit humanity.

**The details: **

* 9 former OpenAI employees joined notable figures like AI ‘godfather’ Geoffrey Hinton in calling to block the startup’s transition from nonprofit to for-profit.

* They argue the move will remove vital nonprofit oversight and safeguards, and redirect AGI development from public benefit to shareholder returns.

* OpenAI needs transition approval from both state AGs by year-end to secure a pending $40B SoftBank investment contingent on the restructuring.

* The letter follows an [earlier motion](https://www.therundown.ai/p/ilyas-ssi-skyrockets-to-32b) by 12 former employees seeking to weigh in on Elon Musk's [lawsuit](https://www.therundown.ai/p/musk-battles-openais-for-profit-push) against the company and CEO Sam Altman.

**Why it matters: **With billions in investments hanging in the balance and both former employees and AI heavyweights lining up against the AI leader, the opposition continues to mount against OpenAI’s for-profit shift — but we’ve seen little movement to suggest the transition is in jeopardy, despite the red flags being raised.

<div>
<a><img/></a>
</div><p>The ongoing antitrust trial against Google has opened new doors for innovation and competition in the tech landscape. OpenAI's expressed interest in acquiring Google's Chrome web browser marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of artificial intelligence and online browsing.</p>
<ul>
<li>The current trial phase involves remedies, with the DOJ advocating for the divestiture of Chrome, which has over 4.1 billion users, to bolster competition.</li>
<li>OpenAI's product manager, Nick Turley, testified that acquiring Chrome would facilitate the creation of an “AI-first browser,” allowing for the integration of AI technologies like ChatGPT to enhance user interaction with the web.</li>
<li>With Chrome’s extensive user base, OpenAI sees an opportunity to introduce innovative AI-driven features, such as personalized recommendations and conversational search, which could differentiate its browser from competitors and refine its AI models through direct user data access.</li>

<div>
<a><img/></a>
</div><p>During Tesla’s Q1 earnings call, CEO Elon Musk made one of his most ambitious predictions yet: “I predict that there will be millions of Teslas on autonomous driving – fully autonomous driving – in the second half of next year.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Tesla plans to launch a pilot for its robotaxi program with a limited fleet of 10 to 20 Model Y vehicles in Austin in June 2025, with the objective to scale rapidly after proving operational reliability.</li>
<li>The company distinguishes itself by relying primarily on camera-based vision and AI for its autonomous systems, contrasting with competitors that utilize a mix of sensors. This strategy allows for theoretically faster scaling as any Tesla with the right hardware can become a robotaxi through software updates.</li>
<li>Following the Austin pilot, Tesla aims to expand its robotaxi services nationwide by the end of 2025, while also planning to allow vehicle owners to join the network by 2026, creating a new income stream for users.</li>
<li>The current charging infrastructure may not support Musk's vision of millions of robotaxis, necessitating significant upgrades to both the Supercharger network and grid capacity to handle increased demand.</li>
<li>Tesla faces stiff competition from established players like Waymo and Zoox, which are already operational. The disappointment in Tesla's recent financial results adds pressure for the robotaxi program to succeed as a potential catalyst for future growth.</li>
